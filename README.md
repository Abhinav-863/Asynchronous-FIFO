# Asynchronous-FIFO
An asynchronous FIFO (First-In, First-Out) is a type of digital circuit commonly used in electronic systems for data buffering and communication between two asynchronous clock domains. Unlike synchronous FIFOs, which require a common clock signal for both read and write operations, asynchronous FIFOs operate without a shared clock, making them suitable for interfacing between different clock domains or systems with varying clock frequencies. This design allows data to be written into and read from the FIFO independently, with synchronization logic ensuring proper data transfer and avoiding potential issues like data loss or corruption due to timing mismatches. Asynchronous FIFOs typically employ techniques such as dual-port RAM and handshaking signals to manage data flow efficiently and reliably across asynchronous boundaries, making them essential components in modern digital systems where disparate clock domains need to communicate seamlessly.
